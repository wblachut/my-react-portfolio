# `WB Portfolio`
[My Portfolio]() to the.
## work in progress...

In future this project will become personal web-site containing pages with information about my work, hobbies and portfolio. It is on it's early stage, consisting only portfolio at the moment. 

The page was build as [React App](https://reactjs.org/).

## Description
On the page load personal information is displayed. I tried to make it simple and minimalistic. To show the portfolio click on the **webDeveloper** paragraph or on the icon in the left-top corner.

The portfolio consists of 12 github repositories. Each of them is represented by the miniature images of the **demo page**. Hovering over them will cause gif and two icons to appear. The first one is a link to **project's demo page** the second one will take you to **project's github repository**.

## Concepts used:

* Functional Components
* Class Components
* Asynchronous data fetch from GitHub REST API inside of lifecycle method

Feel free to leave some comments. If you like the design I invite you to come back here after a year!

## Some concepts to apply in future:

* create a page for skiing and being ski instructor
* create a page about other hobbies, and `about`
* add an animating map with my skills
* make main page more exciting but keeping still simple
* add mouse effects while hovering over links on main page
