# `WB Portfolio`

[Open Portfolio](https://wblachut.github.io/my-react-portfolio/)

###

### ...work in progress!

In future this project will become personal web-site containing pages with information about my work, hobbies and portfolio. It is on it's early stage, consisting only portfolio at the moment.

## Description

The page was build as [React App](https://reactjs.org/).

On the page load personal information is displayed. I tried to make it simple and minimalistic. To show the portfolio click on the `webDeveloper` paragraph or on the `icon` in the left-top corner. The portfolio consists of 12 github `repositories`. Each of them is represented by the miniature images of the **demo page**. Hovering over them will cause gif and two icons to appear. The first one is a link to **project's demo page** the second one will take you to **project's github repository**.
