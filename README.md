# `WB Portfolio`

[Open Portfolio](https://wblachut.github.io/portfolio/)

## work in progress...

In the future this project will become a personal web-site containing pages with information about my work, hobbies and portfolio. It is on it's early stage, consisting only portfolio at the moment.

## Description

For now I tried to make this webpage simple and minimalistic. To show the portfolio click on the `WB portfolio`, `webDeveloper` paragraph or on the `arrow icon` in the left-top corner. The portfolio consists of 12 github `repositories`. Each of them is represented by the miniature images of the **demo page**. Hovering over them will cause gif animation. Clicking on a repo will direct you to **it's demo page** while clicking the github icon will take you obviously to **project's github repository**.

Early stage gif bellow:

The page was build as [React App](https://reactjs.org/).

## Concepts used:

- Functional Components
- Class Components
- Asynchronous data fetch
- GitHub REST API

### Do you like my portfolio?

Feel free to leave some comments. If you like the design I invite you to come back here after a year!

## Some concepts to apply in future:

- [ ] create a page for skiing and being ski instructor
- [ ] create a page about other hobbies, and About ME
- [ ] add an animated mind map of my skills
- [ ] make text appearing on page destructible
- [ ] add mouse effects while hovering over links on main page
- handling fetch with react hook eg. `useAsync`
- make main page more exciting but keeping still simple
- add a downloadable CV file.
- implement section with my friends testimonials
- make the portfolio responsive
